# Jigsaw Puzzle Utils

A helper python library that uses computer vision to help solve jigsaw puzzle

## context

I recently went to Japan and got a pretty [great picture](docs/images/original_img.png) of Tokyo cityscape from Tokyo Skytree, the tallest building in Japan.   

As kind of spur of the moment, I decided to order a [jigsaw puzzle](docs/images/puzzle_box.jpg) of the photo.  

However, after trying to assemble it for a few hours I realized this was more difficult than I imagine and thought this might make for an opportunity to make this into a fun computer vision project.

## installation

- install python 3.11 + poetry
- run `poetry install`
